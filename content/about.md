## Our Aims

GRE aims to bring knowledge of Roman sites out of local archaeological journals and print books into a free open access resource in a consistent format that provides scholars, students, and professionals global access to evidence of all types for ancient garden culture. The entries range from sites that have been excavated using contemporary techniques to early sites where gardens are suspected but not yet proven. In assembling all the known garden evidence for the first time, we aim to expand the scope of research on Roman gardens, as well as to stimulate further field research. The project further aims to preserve this evidence in a stable digital format for future generations. 

At the launch of this project, we are publishing the entries assembled by Wilhelmina Jashemski and a team of area editors working between 1988-2007. We are immediately updating and adding entries for more recently discovered gardens. New editorial teams will be reaching out to archaeologists, and we invite readers to contact us with new contributions!

## History of the Project

Originally modeled on *Gardens of Pompeii*, with its book of essays and catalogue of archaeological sites, Wilhelmina Jashemski planned *Gardens of the Roman Empire* as a far more ambitious project. It has engaged an interdisciplinary team of nearly 200 scholars, students, volunteers, and specialists to assemble a vast body of data into this digital project, which complements, but is independent of, a print volume of essays published by Cambridge University press. Ultimately, this website is designed to publish the assembled catalogue of material in the format in which Jashemski first envisioned it, while using contemporary digital tools to make the data readily navigable. It takes the project forward into the future with essential search tools, links, and maps. The result is a website that realizes her original vision while transforming the project into a fully independent digital forum for research on Roman gardens and designed landscapes.
