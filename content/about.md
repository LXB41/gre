## Purpose of the Project

GRE aims to bring knowledge of Roman sites out of local archaeological journals and print books into a free open access resource in a consistent format that provides scholars, students, and professionals global access to evidence of all types for ancient garden culture. The entries range from sites that have been excavated using contemporary techniques to early sites where gardens are suspected but not yet proven. In assembling all the known garden evidence for the first time, we aim to expand the scope of research on Roman gardens, as well as to stimulate further field research. The project further aims to preserve this evidence in a stable digital format for future generations. 

At the launch of this project, we are publishing the entries assembled by Wilhelmina Jashemski and a team of area editors working between 1988-2007. We are immediately updating and adding entries for more recently discovered gardens. New editorial teams will be reaching out to archaeologists, and we invite readers to contact us with new contributions!
