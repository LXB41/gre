### 14: Notes and Bibliography

#### 14.206: Titles for websites, blogs, and social media

Chapter Contents / Websites, Blogs, and Social Media

Titles of websites are generally set in roman without quotation marks and capitalized headline-style. In a departure from the recommendations in the previous edition, the title of a website that is analogous to a traditionally printed work but does not have (and never had) a printed counterpart can be treated like the titles of other websites, subject to editorial discretion. For example, Wikipedia can be treated as a website rather than as a conventional encyclopedia, with roman rather than italics for the title. (When in doubt, opt for roman.) Titled sections or pages of a website are usually placed in quotation marks. The titles of blogs—like those of journals and other periodicals—can usually be set in italics; titles of blog posts (analogous to articles in a periodical) are placed in quotation marks. (The distinction between a blog and a website is often unclear; when in doubt, treat the title like that of a website.) Many websites do not have titles per se; these can be identified in terms of the entity responsible for the site (and cited accordingly). For additional examples, see 8.191–92.

#### 14.207: Citing web pages and websites

To cite original website content other than the types of formally published sources discussed elsewhere in this chapter, include as much of the following as can be determined: the title or description of the specific page (if cited); the title or description of the site as a whole (see 14.206); the owner or sponsor of the site; and a URL. The word *website* (or *web page*) may be added (in parentheses) after the title or description of the site if the nature of the source may otherwise be unclear. Also include a publication date or date of revision or modification (see 14.13); if no such date can be determined, include an access date (see 14.12). For frequently updated resources, a time stamp may be included (as in the Wikipedia example, which records the time as it was listed with the source; see also 9.39). Citations of website content can often be limited to the notes; in works with no notes, they may be included in the bibliography (cited by the owner or sponsor of the site).
