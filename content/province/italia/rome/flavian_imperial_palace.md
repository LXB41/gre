### Garden Description

During the period of Domitian (81-96 CE) a large artificial platform with massive substructures at the north, east and west was completed at the site of the [Vigna Barberini](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_Barberini). On this platform stood a large structure with a curvilinear plan at the south, and with [colonnaded](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002613) aisles on the east and west (the north is not excavated) that enclosed a vast garden (Fig. 5).  Over one-third of this garden area has been partly explored, another third was irrevocably destroyed when the later [*Temple of Elagabalus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elagabalium) was built, and the final third, at the north, remains to be excavated.

Only a few elements of the ancient garden were found in place.  In particular, a large rectangular basin (measuring 8.70 meters by 5.30 meters), ornamented with alternating rectangular and semi-circular [niches](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704) faced in marble, was on axis with the center of the curved [façade](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002526).  Shortly after construction, settling of the soil used to create the artificial [terrace](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004182) caused a rapid degradation of the whole northern section of the garden. During Hadrian’s reign, refurbishment and re-construction was undertaken, the results of which lasted up to the end of the second century CE. This second phase is better recorded than the first, but it is possible that care was taken to preserve at least some trees of the Flavian period.

The Hadrianic garden was enclosed by a [*portico*]((http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145), presumably an [*ambulatio*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ambulatio) - a common feature of Roman gardens (Figs. 6, 7).  Running parallel to the east and west [colonnades](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002613) were wide strips of beaten clay bordered on the inside by medium-sized trees, possibly laurels.  In the middle of the garden were likely three (two have been identified) parallel clay paths running north-south. At the southern terminus of the central path is a small masonry formation, possibly the base of an [altar](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300003725), flanked by two concrete bases covered with white [marble](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011443).

At the south (the only excavated area), at least, two other paths run east-west, forming a regular gridded pattern. It is possible that the entire garden had an [orthogonal](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Orthogonal_plan) layout of paths that were re-surfaced numerous times throughout the second century. At the corners of the crossings were discovered square and rectangular bases of masonry that likely supported [sculptures](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600). In addition, several [flowerpots](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300194749) came to light at the corners of these bases, as well as inside the rectangular beds formed by the paths.

On either side of the southernmost statue bases (those nearest the curvilinear portico) were two [fountains](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179), of which the only remains *in situ* is a marble slab framed by [plinths](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001749), forming a shallow basin with a hole in its center to receive a lead pipe (Fig. 9). A circular imprint (0.69 meters in diameter) on the surface of this slab suggests that water would have cascaded from an upper basin onto the shallow rectangular basin, out through a hole in the side of the [plinth](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001749) and into a marble [canal](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006075) connected to the main water collecting system underground. This canal ran just outside the curved portico in a position to collect rainwater from the roof, but because of the considerable width (1.8 meters) it also functioned as a decorative device. The few numbers of manholes for drainage could have been easily closed to allow water to remain in this canal; not only to cool the air, but also to reflect the [columns](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571) of the *portico* and the nearby plants.   

Based on the imprint of lead pipes identified during excavation and the network of underground drainage, a large [fountain](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179) further north, not uncovered, was likely on the north-south median axis of the garden. Furthermore, scant remains of a building, destroyed by the later Severan temple as well as by earlier archaeological excavations, have come to light on the same north-south central axis.  The thin walls suggest a simple garden kiosk that would have been adorned by at least two marble columns (no longer extant), the bases for which were richly carved with leaves and shells.

Throughout the second century a series of repairs attempted to slow the subsiding soil on the platform, but to no avail. Perhaps also as a result of a fire, which raged through Rome in 191/192, the gardens and buildings on the site of the Vigna Barberini were destroyed and the construction of a new monumental complex was undertaken.

### Figures

Figure 5. Reconstruction of the Flavian Palace with, in the forefront, the main body of the complex excavated at the Vigna Barberini. The computer-generated three-dimensional model of the northern body was carried out by N. André, in collaboration with F. Villedieu, based on excavation findings gathered under the direction of H. Broise, J.-P. Morel, P. Pergola, Y. Thébert and F. Villedieu. The model of the southern section of the palace was designed by N. André and S. Appert, in collaboration with F. Villedieu, based on past drawings and reconstructions by H. A. Deglane, F. Dutert and, especially, I. Gismondi.

Figure 9. Base of a fountain composed of a square marble slab and four long, narrow slabs placed edgewise along its sides. On the rear slab is a disc left by the foot of a basin, which would have once stood here. At the centre of the slab is a hole through which pipe would have carried water to the fountain. From the upper basin, water cascaded onto the base and would have flowed out through the opening carved at the centre of the structure’s side. From there, it flowed into a channel connected to the main water collecting system.

Figure 11. Detail of the marble canal at the outer edge of the portico that framed the garden. This canal gathered rainwater from the level above the portico and emptied it into the sewage system below. By closing off the few manholes, it may also have been used as a basin to cool and beautify the garden.
