### Garden Description

Knowledge of this *thermae*, or bathing complex, and its associated public gardens comes from textual evidence and the Severan marble plan ([*FUR*](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/index.php)) (Figs. 1–2). Located in the central Campus Martius, Agrippa’s *thermae* were associated with his *horti*; upon his death in 12 BCE, he left both to the Roman people, free of charge (Cass. Dio 54.29.4).

The *horti* included a grove with plane trees and an artificial lake. Starting in 25 BCE, Agrippa constructed a gymnasium which he called *Laconian sudatorium*, after the Spartans who were famous for their exercise regimens (Cass. Dio 53.27.1). After 19 BCE, the *Aqua Virgo* supplied the complex and its grounds with an abundant source of fresh water (Frontinus Aq. 1.10), transforming it into a park and full-fledged bathing complex, the first of the imperial *thermae*.

In this complex, a grove (*alsos*) was situated between two manmade bodies of water (Strabo 13.1.19): a *stagnum* (lake) and a *euripus* (canal). The baths contained famous paintings and elaborate decoration, while Agrippa placed famous works of art, including sculptures of animals, including a bronze bear (Martial *Ep.* 3.19.1–2), and a lion by Lysippus (Strabo 13.1.19) in the grove. In front of the complex was the famous Apoxyomenos (the body scraper), also by Lysippus (Plin. HN 34.62). The *Hecatostylum*, lying just south of the *euripus*, may have served as a covered walkway for the grove and functioned as a *de facto* boundary of the complex (Martial 3.19.1-2).

Seneca the Younger reports that he used to celebrate the new year by jumping into the cold canal (associated with the Aqua Virgo) (*Ep.* 83.5); this suggests that the *stagnum* and *euripus* were also recreational spaces for the people of Rome. While there is no direct reference to swimming in the *stagnum*, the lake was large enough space that Nero was able to enjoy a sumptuous banquet, while floating on a raft (Tac. *Ann.* 15.37), suggesting that the *stagnum* could have recreational purposes.

The *thermae* burned in the fire of 80 CE (Cass. Dio  66.24) and was restored quickly by Titus or Domitian (Martial 3.20.15, 36.6). Restorations by Hadrian, Constantius and Constans are known. According to Sidonius Apollinarus, the baths are mentioned in the regionary catalogues and were still in use in the fifth century and (*Carm.* 23.496).
