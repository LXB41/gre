### Garden Description

Knowledge of this [*thermae*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007364), or bathing complex, and its associated public gardens comes from textual evidence and the Severan marble plan ([*FUR*](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/index.php)) (Figs. 1–2). Located in the central Campus Martius, Agrippa’s *thermae* were associated with his [*horti*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008107); upon his death in 12 BCE, he left both to the Roman people, free of charge ([Cass. Dio 54.29.4](https://bit.ly/CDioE54)).

The [*horti*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008107) included a grove with plane trees and an artificial lake. Starting in 25 BCE, Agrippa constructed a gymnasium which he called *Laconian sudatorium*, after the Spartans who were famous for their exercise regimens ([Cass. Dio 53.27.1](https://bit.ly/CDioE53)). After 19 BCE, the [*Aqua Virgo*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aqua-Virgo) supplied the complex and its grounds with an abundant source of fresh water ([Frontinus Aq. 1.10](https://bit.ly/DeAquisE)), transforming it into a park and full-fledged bathing complex, the first of the imperial *thermae*.

In this complex, a grove ([*alsos*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ἄλσος)) was situated between two manmade bodies of water ([Strabo 13.1.19](https://bit.ly/Strabo13A1)): a [*stagnum*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stagnum) (lake) and a [*euripus*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/euripus) (canal). The baths contained famous paintings and elaborate decoration, while Agrippa placed famous works of art, including sculptures of animals, including a bronze bear ([Martial *Ep.* 3.19.1–2](https://topostext.org/work/677)), and a lion by [Lysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysippos) ([Strabo 13.1.19](https://bit.ly/Strabo13A1)) in the grove. In front of the complex was the famous [Apoxyomenos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoxyomenos) (the body scraper), also by Lysippus (Plin. HN 34.62). The [*Hecatostylum*](https://www.digitalaugustanrome.org/records/hecatostylum/), lying just south of the *euripus*, may have served as a covered walkway for the grove and functioned as a *de facto* boundary of the complex ([Martial *Ep.* 3.19.1–2](https://topostext.org/work/677)).

[Seneca the Younger](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lucius-Annaeus-Seneca-Roman-philosopher-and-statesman) reports that he used to celebrate the new year by jumping into the cold canal (associated with the Aqua Virgo) ([*Ep.* 83.5](http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi1017.phi015.perseus-lat1:83)); this suggests that the *stagnum* and *euripus* were also recreational spaces for the people of Rome. While there is no direct reference to swimming in the *stagnum*, the lake was large enough that [Nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero) was able to enjoy a sumptuous banquet, while floating on a raft ([Tac. *Ann.* 15.37](https://bit.ly/TacAnE15B)), suggesting that the *stagnum* could have recreational purposes.

The *thermae* burned in the fire of 80 CE ([Cass. Dio 66.24](https://bit.ly/CDioE66)) and was restored quickly by Titus or Domitian ([Martial 3.20.15, 36.6](https://topostext.org/work/677). Restorations by [Hadrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian), [Constantius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantius_II) and [Constans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constans) are known. According to [Sidonius Apollinaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidonius_Apollinaris), the baths are mentioned in the regionary catalogues and were still in use in the fifth century ([*Carm.* 23.496](http://archive.org/details/poemsletterswith01sidouoft/page/316/mode/2up?view=theater)).
