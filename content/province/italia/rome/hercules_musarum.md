### Garden Description

The [*Aedes Hercules Musarum*](http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/TS-031.html) was located in the southern [Campus Martius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Martius). It was enclosed by the [*Porticus Philippi*](http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/HTML/PO-010.html) (61 x 92 m.) in the late Republican period. Known from several fragments of the [Forma Urbis Romae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forma_Urbis_Romae) (Figs. 1–2), it was also adjacent (to the northwest) to the [*Porticus Octaviae*](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/nash/feature/the-porticus-of-octavia). [M. Fulvius Nobilior](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Fulvius-Nobilior), consul in 189 BCE (and censor with [M. Aemilius Lepidus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Aemilius-Lepidus-Roman-statesman-died-152-BC) in 179 BCE), may have built the temple between 187 and 179 BCE (Eumen. Pan. 5.7.3) after his triumph. Ovid ([*Fast.* 6.801–2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0547%3Abook%3D6)) and Suetonius ([Aug. 29.5](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0061%3Alife%3Daug.%3Achapter%3D29%3Asection%3D5)) state that [L. Marcius Philippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Marcius_Philippus_(consul_38_BC)) (who had a triumph in 34 or 33 BCE) restored the temple and built the portico around it.

Knowledge of the complex derives primarily from the marble plan and ancient sources. The complex consisted of a circular [*aedes*](http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=&logic=AND&note=&subjectid=300007560) (temple) dedicated to Hercules Musarum (Hercules of the Muses) set within a [*porticus*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) (Fig. 2). In the mid-1980s, P.A. Gianfrotta excavated a small part of the central edifice, discovering a small interior corridor (1 m. wide), restored in the imperial period. These excavations demonstrated that few alterations had been made to the original structure, suggesting that the [Forma Urbis Romae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forma_Urbis_Romae) depicts the original portico. The temple was located on a south-facing [podium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300000976) (c. 48 x 21 m., H 3.5 m) with an [*exedra*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589) (diam. 11 m). On the sides of podium were a series of twelve [niches](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704) (W. 3.5 m), where the [*fasti*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fasti-Roman-calendar) may have been displayed ([Macrob. *Sat.* 1.12.16](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/1*.html)). North of the podium were nine bases, possibly for [statues](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300047600) for the nine Muses of Ambracia ([Plin. *HN* 35.66](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/35*.html); [Ov. *Fast.* 6.797–812](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0547%3Abook%3D6)).  

The FUR shows that the [temple]((http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007595)) was surrounded by two rows of dots that are closely, but not perfectly, aligned. Richardson argued the dots represent a double portico; however, Castagnoli argues that the inner row of dots were trees. The different spacing of the inner dots (4–5 m.) and of the outer dots (3–4 m.) would also prove problematic in a double portico and lends support to Castagnoli’s interpretation. The elevation difference between the portico and ground level was also *c.* 3 m., further supporting Castagnoli’s interpretation. Thus, the dots could be interpreted as a *lucus* (or [grove](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300008884)), perhaps of the [poplars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus_alba) associated with the cult of Hercules and a flood-tolerant species suitable to the Campus Martius.

The *collegium poetarum* ([Val. Max. 3.7.11](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0675%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D11); [Plin. *HN* 34.19](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/34*.html)) formally gathered near the complex, and so perhaps the *porticus* and its *exedra* could have housed a poetics school with an [auditorium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004394) for lectures, discussions of poetry and works of art; perhaps functioning like an Alexandrian-inspired [*Museion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaeum).

The porticus was at a significantly higher level than the interior courtyard. No connection (i.e. steps) is identified on the plan. Either a raised temple or porticus are possible. The following two sections illustrate the difference in elevations. The second option shows the portico at ground level and the temple elevated. This would allow for access to and from portico and temple. (Linda Anderson)." >}}
