### Garden Description

Located on the Oppian hill between the *Clivus Suburanus* and the later Baths of Trajan (*Thermae Traiani*) in the *Subura*, the *Porticus Liviae* is represented on [three fragments of the Severan marble plan (*FUR*)](https://formaurbis.stanford.edu/index.php?field0=all&search0=liviae&op0=and&field1=all&search1=porticus). The public *porticus* was constructed on the site of the grand *domus* of Publius Vedius Pollio, who bequeathed his property to Augustus upon his death. Augustus constructed the *porticus* in the name of his wife, Livia. With her son Tiberius, Livia dedicated the complex to Concordia in January 7 BCE. (Ovid *Fast.* 6.637–48; Suet. *Aug.* 29; Dio Cassius 54.23.6, 55.8.2). The complex was accessed via two flights of stairs from the *Clivus Suburanus*.

The *porticus* (ca. 120 x 75 m.) was enclosed by an outer wall and a roofed double colonnade. There are large rectangular and circular *exedrae* set behind the individual porticoes. In the center of the *porticus* was a large rectangular central feature, and four small features were located at the corners of the colonnades. Scholars debate whether the large central feature was a fountain or, more likely, a shrine to *Concordia*, dedicated to marital concord and harmony, a major theme of Augustan propaganda. Ovid mentions a shrine to Concordia (Ovid *Fast.* 6.637–48). The function of the four smaller features located at the corners of the colonnades is also uncertain; perhaps, they were fountains or small niches for the display of statues.

The porticus featured a central garden. Pliny writes of a single, productive vine stock that covered the walkway with shade (Pliny, HN 14.11), creating a pergola-like effect. The vines were also productive, reportedly producing twelve *amphorae* of wine per year. A collection of paintings was also displayed in the *porticus* (Ovid, *Ars Am.* 171–72; Strabo 5.3.8). As in other porticoes, Romans would stroll, meet their lovers, or make appointments to meet each other here (Plin. *Ep.* 1.5.9).

Excavations in 1984 identified pre- and post-Augustan phases, but provided no information about possible gardens. The excavations suggest that porticus remained in use until the fifth century CE, but that by the mid-sixth century the *porticus* was being used for burials.
