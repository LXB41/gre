## Province Description

Italia was not considered a province until the reign of Diocletian. The peninsula, however, was divided into administrative regions by Augustus around 7 BCE, according to Pliny's *Naturalis Historia*. Regio I was comprised of Latium and Campania.<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
In the Republican period, by the 1st century BCE, the Palatine had small but numerous gardens associated with well-appointed houses situated on this hill.  Among these numerous residences were those of [L. Lucius Crassus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Licinius_Crassus), famous for its six majestic nettle-trees (celtis australis) ([Plin. N.H., 17, 3-6](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D17%3Achapter%3D3)) and the *domus* of [M. Tullius Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero), which offered the author “all the pleasures that gardens can give” ([ad Quintum III.1,4](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/fratrem3.shtml)). Cicero's house even included a Greek-style *palaestra* with a *laconicum* ([Cic. ad Att. II.4,7](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/att2.shtml), as well as an *ambulatio* or *portico* for promenades ([CIL VI, 29774-29775](https://cil.bbaw.de/hauptnavigation/das-cil/baende)). At the beginning of the Augustan period gardens had become almost as much a necessity for Romans as houses, and one must suppose that no *domus* of any importance lacked a peripheral garden or one planted within a peristyle.
