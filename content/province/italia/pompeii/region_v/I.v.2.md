Officina Coriariorum of M. Vesonius Primus (tannery) with a [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden and large open space to the rear.


### Garden Description
A. This tannery was excavated in 1873-1874. The [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) courtyard had a [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) to the north and east supported by brick pillars which had been most likely been built when the original house was converted to a tannery. Against the west wall there was a masonry [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) (l. medius 4.99m; l. summus and l. imus 4.96m; table, 1.78 x 0.93m). The top of the [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) table held the famous mosaic of a skull 0.45 x 0.50m (Mus. Naz. inv. no. 109 982; Reusch no. 163). Here a mosaic representing the Epicurian philosophy and featuring a large skull over a butterfly on a wheel, indicative of the soul and time, was found here. On either side of the skull are the possessions of both the rich and poor with a plumb line hanging over the skull indicating the equalizing power of death. The northeastern part of the courtyard was a rectangle, the north side of which was formed by the three first intercolumniations counting from the northeast corner of the north [portico](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145), and the east side by the first two intercolumniations counting from the same corner. This area was paved with *opus signinum*. The little area around the [triclinium](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004359) between the paved area and the west wall was believed to be a garden according to Mau.

B. The south half of the insula was also excavated in 1873-74. It was accessed from the back door in the [peristyle](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300080971) garden of the tannery by descending six steps. This was a large open area that had been cleared of previous structures. Formerly there had been five doors in the south wall leading to the *pomerium* but these were closed up. This area could have been used as a kitchen garden as suggested by Tatiana Warscher or for drying leather as suggested by Viola.
