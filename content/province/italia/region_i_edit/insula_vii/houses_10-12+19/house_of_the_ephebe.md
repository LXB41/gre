### Garden Description

A. This house was made by combining several small houses. The upper garden (a) had an unusual portico on the north with various diameter columns, plastered and painted red, and two pillars. A third column on a square base supported an extension of the *portico*, which was a step lower and formed by an extension of the vestibule at entrance 12. The *triclinium* (b), *tablinium* (c), and *exedra* (d) on the upper level of the *portico* were protected from cold and rain by some sort of screen installed between the columns and the west pillar. Most scholars surmise these were wooden but Maiuri proposed that they were glass, although he did not find any glass fragments during excavation. (Window panes surviving from this period from other sites are on display at the Museo Archaeological in Naples and in the deposito at Pompeii).

Two steps below the *portico* was the garden (a). The back wall had a large animal painting and a small *aedicula* with a semicircular niche. A relief of Dianna and two deer adorned the front and inside a bronze statuette fountain of Pomona (0.38 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 144 276) stood holding a bivalve shell filled with fruit. Water jetted from the shell, down four marble steps and into the small square pool below. A marble covered channel divided the *lectus medius* of the *triclinium* in two parts and carried the water to a small jet in the center of the low *triclinium* table. Four large columns supported a vine-covered pergola that shaded the *triclinium*. The soil near the columns had root cavities, as reported by Maiuri, but no further details were recorded. Fig. 3.

This was the best preserved *triclinium* (*l. medius*, 4.60 m.; *l. imus* and *l. summus* 4.40 x 0.88 m.) in the entire city. Each couch had a marble faced step along the top, and on the sides of the *triclinium* was painted a series of Nilotic scenes. There were two complete paintings while the rest of the work comprised a continuous frieze. These scenes depicted Egyptian life that revolved around the periodic inundation of the Nile. Activities pictured included men fishing, a woman spinning under a canopy, worshipers visiting shrines, (some shrines in enclosures, some with extensive gardens), banquet scenes, an erotic scene in a caupona, and a pigmy slave driving a *coclea* (water screw). Fig. 4.

Attached to each of the north columns of the pergola was a low column (1.00 m. high) which most likely served as bases for statuettes. In front and a little to the west of the *lectus summus* was a large masonry base (0.93 m. high; 0.685 m. in dia.) where Maiuri surmised that the famous bronze statue of the Ephebe stood. This statue (1.49 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. no. 143 753) had been made into a gilded lamp stand holding candelabra brackets and was found in the *atrium* where it had been wrapped and placed for protection against the impending disaster. At either end of the *portico* was an additional pair of low circular bases for statuettes. Four broken marble statuettes were found in the *triclinium* where they most likely were brought for protection or perhaps for repair after the earthquake. A statuette of Pan holding a fruit-filled *calathos* on his left shoulder and a ram’s head in his right hand (0.60 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3682) was reconstructed from nineteen fragments. The white marble piece had been completely gilded. There was also an inebriated satyr of white marble, (the head was missing) sprawled on a gray marble rock and opening a wineskin (0.32 m. long; 0.27 m. high with base; Pompeii inv. no. 3684). Only the necklace, bracelet, and several other details were gilded on this piece. A completely gilded statuette of a deer suckling a fawn (0.35 m. long; 0.22 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3683) and the remains of a gray marble base with white marble goat feet of Pan standing on a *scabellum*, the typical instrument of satyrs, (0.28 m. long; 0. 105 m. high; Pompeii inv. no. 3685) were found there. There were also four vulgar silver-plated statuettes of *placentarii* or pastry vendors (each with base, 0.255 m. high; Mus. Naz. inv. nos. 143 758, 143 759, 143 761, 143 761 bis). Each carried a silver tray which Maiuri surmised were used to hold food delicacies served at dinner parties in the garden *triclinium*. The statuettes as well as the delicacies were found stored together in the house.

A trellis fence separated the *triclinium* from the eastern part of the garden. Fig. 5. The trellis was supported by four slender marble posts and on top of these were four small sculptured heads. These pieces were: an archaic style head of Zeus rendered in white marble (0.19 m. high) with traces of bright colors, an archaic bust of Hera (0.135 m. high) and also a head of a woman (0.145 m. high) carved in yellow marble, and a Bacchic head of a child made from red marble. A plain round table and a curved marble seat were found in the center of the garden. Fig. 6. The excavation revealed soil arranged in furrows, as customary for vegetable gardens, and root cavities of small plants.

Water was supplied to the garden by way of overflow channels from the *triclinium* fountain. A basin, with two terra-cotta openings which would regulate the flow of water to either half of the garden, was located at the edge of the garden. <span style="color:green">The south wall at the rear of the *triclinium* once had a large hunt scene, but the only surviving part was the lower register. To the left of the *aedicula* fountain the images of a large deer and a bird remain, and to the right a bull flees from an unidentified attacker. A feline is crouched under a large tree in the lower right and other trees are sketchily depicted in the background.</span>
